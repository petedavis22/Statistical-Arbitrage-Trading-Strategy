# Statistical-Arbitrage-Trading-Strategy
I worked with a group of five to back-test and develop a statistical arbitrage trading algorithm. We found significantly correlated stock pairs and performed Dicky Fuller Test to validate ten significant pairs. We trained model on two years of data and generated $105,808 on out-of-sample test of two months.

We Utilized WRDS database to pull stock data.

Our powerpoint presentation is under the file name 'Investment Strategy - Statistical Arbitrage.pptx'. 

Our python code is under the file name 'AM Project Execute.ipynb'.
